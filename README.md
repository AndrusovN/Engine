# Engine
A 3D engine on c++ SFML inspired by Unity

This is a 3D engine made with C++ SFML. It is inspired by Unity engine (so the architecture is pretty similar), but it is simpler.
I wrote it in summer of 2018, but push it to github only in 2021, sorry(
It can process .obj files to read 3D objects and show them on the screen. Also it has simple lightning system, but has no shadows(
You can move yourself with WASD and rotate yourself with QEZX
